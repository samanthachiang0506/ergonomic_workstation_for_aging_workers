# ergonomic_workstation_for_aging_workers
A team-based design project focused on developing an ergonomic workstation for aging workers.

With the aging workforce becoming increasingly prevalent in service and maintenance industries, this project focuses on addressing the physical challenges faced by older workers in constrained and poorly optimized environments. The case subject, a 60-year-old hotel laundry worker, operates in an underground workspace with limited lighting and air circulation.

Observed issues included spinal discomfort resulting from repetitive bending and squatting motions, as well as visual strain caused by inadequate illumination. These factors not only affected physical health but also posed potential long-term occupational risks.

The motivation behind this design was to proactively reduce such risks through an ergonomic workstation that integrates adjustable working heights, improved visual accessibility, and workflow optimization. The proposed solution aims to enhance occupational sustainability by accommodating age-related physical changes rather than forcing workers to adapt to rigid, non-ergonomic systems.
